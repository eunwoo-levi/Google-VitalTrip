# 📌 Project Overview

- Project Name: VitalTrip
- Duration: March 24, 2025 – May 16, 2025

# 🎯 Purpose

In the post-COVID-19 era, international travel has surged. However, many travelers still face significant anxiety due to language barriers, cultural differences, and limited knowledge of foreign healthcare systems.

According to WHO and global travel agencies, travelers often report communication issues and inaccessibility to hospitals as major pain points when receiving medical care abroad.

VitalTrip is designed to address these global issues. It helps users quickly locate nearby healthcare facilities and breaks down language barriers so they can communicate their symptoms effectively. With AI-powered first aid advice and chatbot support, VitalTrip offers both emergency action guidance and emotional stability in crisis situations.

#### Not just a travel companion — VitalTrip is a life-saving tool for global travelers.
